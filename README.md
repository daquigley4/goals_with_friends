# Goals with Friends!

##Overview:
A simple web application that can help you and your friends keep each other accountable in pursuit of your goals.

#### Features:
##### Goal Tracking:
-You can create goals and keep track of when it is due.  You can check off your goals as you complete them.

##### Task Tracking:
-You can create tasks associated to a specific goal to help you break it down into smaller steps.  After you complete tasks you can check them off.

#### Issues:

**Routing:** 
I built my application using three nested models.  The routes got complicated because they needed a number of parameters at times.  I had to troubleshoot through a lot of routing error messages.  


**Pushing to Heroku:**
I ran into an issue pushing to Heroku because I created my git repository in a parent directory.  Heroku was not able to recognize my app until I moved all the files into the parent directory.

#### Technologies Used:
-Languages: HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, SASS, Active Record, Heroku
